The Lost Cities Squared Dev-2:
* New "experimental" profile for my testing. May work, may not.  
* Library.json changes:
  * Brewing stands will generate less frequently in city's.
  * Enchanting tables will generate less frequently city's.
  * Slight chance to generate air in place of crafting tables or furances.
* Un-privated the "bio_wasteland" and "water_empty" profiles. They are used internally for waterbubbles and biospheres respectively.
* Removed the ugly Blue and Light Blue glass colors from generating in cities.
* Changed the Mod name and Verison.
