Upcoming:
- Temporary 'fix' to avoid what looks like a bug in Vanilla when clearing out large sections of a chunk. This bug manifests itself when clearing up chunks after being damaged by an explosion
- Better city generation with 'floating' landscape type by improving the way the height of a chunk is detected
- New 'cityAvoidVoid' config option: Only used with floating landscape type: if true an additional detection is done to see if the chunk is void and in that case the city isn't generated there. Otherwise you might get city chunks on the border of islands which sometimes looks weird

1.16-4.0.3-alpha:
- Considerably improved Lost City worldgen on world types that use the standard NoiseChunkGenerator

1.16-4.0.2-alpha:
- Register the configured feature for Lost Cities so that it should improve compatibility with other mods generation

1.16-4.0.1-alpha:
- Some serious optimizations which will improve the speed of worldgen in combination with lost cities

1.16-4.0.0-alpha:
- First port to 1.16.3: alpha!

1.15-3.0.2-alpha:
- Fixed a problem on servers

3.0.1-alpha:
- Avoid generating Lost Cities in biomes that are marked as 'void'
- Avoid a crash with some blocks (beehives) causing out of bounds errors during chunk generation
- mmcgill refined the above fix so the crash testing is actually not really needed

2.0.28-alpha:
- Fixed a crash in Lost Cities loading existing worlds

2.0.27-alpha:
- Added lc_cavern worldtype for cavern style worlds
- The Lost City configuration screen (LC button) will now select 'cavern' as first option if you are using lc_cavern
- New 'Transport' configuration page so that you can configure railways and highways
- The standard profiles as they are saved in the config/lostcity_profiles are now read-only and will be generated again everytime the game starts. You can make a copy of them under a new name and modify it for your own needs
- Nicer Lost City configuration button

2.0.26-alpha:
- Fixed a problem with cities generating under very high biomes. Sometimes pieces of the original landscape were still present
- Potentially fixed an issue correcting block states in a not-fully-generated chunk
- Fixed the check if a biome is an ocean or not
- Fixed the detection of biomes in general
- Lower the stone border a few blocks so it is always covered by terrain (there were sometimes gaps with ocean chunks adjacent to street chunks)
- Clear land above above-ground railway stations

2.0.25-alpha:
- Fixed generation of bridges. They never really appeared
- Slightly changed the offset of lower mesh terrain gen so it always matches (remove configs for this to work)
- Fixed a problem where customizing a profile could cause crashes

2.0.24-alpha:
- Implemented a much better landscape correcting algorithm so that city chunks fit much better with adjacent high mountains or very low ocean chunks
- Vines are now handled in a much more efficient manner. Should avoid the TPS problems people were getting
- Oceans, rivers, and beaches are now recognized in a way that allows modded biomes to work too
- When a highway is generated it will no longer remove leaf blocks and logs above the highway
- When Lost Cities starts for the first time it will generate a config/lostcity_profiles folder containing standard profiles. As long as that folder exists Lost Cities will not do that again. You can alter/copy/remove profiles in that directory and they will be recognized automatically
- New 'saveprofile' command to save the current profile to a file (which you can then copy to config/lostcity_profiles)

2.0.23-alpha:
- Fixed a problem on servers

2.0.22-alpha:
- First port to 1.14.4!

2.0.21:
- Joseph added a more useful error message when invalid parts are configured

2.0.20:
- Fixed water level issue when combining biosphere with drowned cities, thanks to @3TUSK
- New parkChance profile option that allows you to control the chance that a non-building section will be a park section. If you set this to 0 you will only get streets
- wormzjl fixed explosion leaving a crater on water surface in submerged city style
- wormzjl reports: currently when combining sphere with submerged cities, all outside ground appears to be a mixture of grass + sand, creating a lot of block update lag. This temporarily fixes this issue by replacing underwater toppings with gravel

2.0.19:
- The client support (including fog) was accidentally removed

2.0.18:
- Spanish (Argentina) support for the generator names from TBM13
- English (upside-down) support for the generator names from The Fireplace
- Fix a possible crash in case a compact machine is placed in a city sphere (by Thraaawn)
- Force filtered biomes to actually check for allowed biomes (by esotericist)

2.0.17:
- Fixed a rare crash with explosion handling during generation

2.0.16:
- Umbra Gaming fixed a sponge compatibility issue

2.0.15:
- Fixed a problem in the safe driver which caused it to crash

2.0.14:
- New config option 'optimizedChunkgen' that can be used to disable the optimized chunkgen that Lost Cities normally uses and switch to a 'safer' version
- If NEID or JEID is installed this new safer chunkgen is used automatically

2.0.13:
- Joseph added more useful error reporting if a factor or mapping is invalid

2.0.12:
- New profile config option to change the default base liquid to use while generating the world ('liquidBlock')
- New profile config option to change the default base block to use while generating the world ('baseBlock')

2.0.11:
- Log an error if we detect that a block's TileEntity is wrong

2.0.10:
- Removed some spam from the console

2.0.9:
- Fixed a crash bug in combination with the Aroma Mining Dimension

2.0.8:
- Added support for multiple Lost City dimensions through the new ADDITIONAL_DIMENSIONS config. These dimensions are not accessible with the usual method. They are mostly intended for pack devs who need multiple city dimensions with various properties (profiles)
