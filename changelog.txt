1.18-5.3.2:
- More diagnostics to check a problem with pregenerating chunks

1.18-5.3.1:
- Now the registry system properly supports namespaces. Default namespace is 'lostcities'

1.18-5.3.0:
- Various improvements to the configuration GUI. The preview is now larger too
- Removed several config options that no longer work or are no longer relevant
- Cleaned up a lot of code
- The spawn configuration options are back
- Added forceSpawnInBuilding to force the spawn inside a building (might fail if there is no building near spawn)
- New feature where you can specify rubble blocks for a building. These will be used instead of the filler block but only for when buildings are damaged and spill over in adjacent chunks
- New 'variant' asset type where you can define sets of blocks that can then be used in palettes. This makes defining different palettes easier
- All assets are now converted to datapack objects. This totally changes the way you can reconfigure Lost Cities
- Expanded the worldstyle asset type with a new 'citychancemultipliers' section that allows you to specify biomes where cities should spawn less or more
- The city biome factors have been removed from the profile. This is now better handled in the asset system (worldstyle)
- The standard worldstyle avoids rivers slightly and oceans a bit more

1.18-5.2.6:
- New system to control city rarity based on perlin maps. If the cityChance setting is -1 then cityPerlinScale and cityPerlinOffset will be used for a more natural city style
- New 'cityStyleThreshold' and 'cityStyleAlternative' that can be used to select another city style for low city thresholds
- New 'largecities' profile using the new setting. It presents very large cities that are relatively rare. It also uses an alternative city style at the borders of the city
- Removed the non functional chisel worldstyle and palettes
- Having a missing asset file is no longer a crashing error but it will put an error in the log and ignore the asset
- Citystyles can now override the building chance
- Fixed a bug with feature placement for datapack biomes

1.18-5.2.5:
- Fixed a problem where spawners might not be correctly set if the Lost City world is exited and loaded again

1.18-5.2.4:
- All mob spawners were spawning pigs. This is fixed now
- The Lost Cities events are back (useful for mods who want to do something special to LC worldgen)
- Cellars at level -1 didn't correctly connect to adjacent corridors in Z direction
- Fixed a problem with heightmaps being stored with bytes. But worldheight no longer fits in a byte. This could cause worldgen issues
- Made borders below buildings and streets only go as deep as needed. This means that you will no longer have ugly borders going down into caves from buildings on top of it
- The test if a chunk is an ocean chunk was totally wrong. This caused some generation to be ugly. Cleaned up biome test code
- Small optimizations
- Added a new 'grass' block to the 'parkblocks' in the city style so that you can use the full palette system for grass in parks
- Added a new 'generalblocks' section to city style so you can specify a few more blocks ('ironbars', 'glowstone', ...)
- New configuration option 'oceanCorrectionBorder' that can be used to change how chunks adjacent to ocean/city chunks will be corrected

1.18-5.2.3:
- It's now possible to use random block palettes for streets too
- Big speed improvement in the Lost City profile selection screen when rendering the world preview
- Saplings in Lost City parks will generate trees again
- 'cityChance' now has double precision which makes it possible to make cities even more rare
- More expansions to the lost city api
- Fixed a problem with corridor generation. Too often it resulted in floating rails
- Fixed redstone torches not being correctly lit

1.18-5.2.2:
- New method in the API to load additional assets
- New API so that other mods can add custom profiles
- Chests could float if the building around it was destroyed by explosions

1.18-5.2.1:
- New createbuilding command to create a building
- Fixes in chest generation and lighting updates
- Fixed a potential race conditions with mods using the Lost Cities API

1.18-5.2.0:
- Another optimization on worldgen
- Fixed a problem with connecting walls and glass slabs that got broken in the previous release
- Fixed a bug in the explosion correction code
- Much better explosion damage propagation upwards so that there is less floating geometry
- Code cleanups and small fixes
- New feature where a building can override the palette used by the parts
- Added 3 new building types using that feature with more modern building blocks
- Fixed placement of torches

1.18-5.1.2:
- Much more stable way to generate the Lost City chunks. No more worldgen warnings and tallbuildings profile works again
- MUCH faster way to detect (and delete) floating building parts after being damaged by explosions. It is however slightly less accurate

1.18-5.1.1:
- Fixed a problem with the seed of the custom dimension

1.18-5.1.0:
- Port to 1.18.2

1.18-5.0.4:
- API for registering Lost City dimensions
- Improved placement of wallblocks

1.18-5.0.3:
- Fixed the Lost City dimension. Also added a safety check when trying to teleport to such a dimension (with the bed)

1.18-5.0.2:
- Properly fixed the problem on single player where exiting the world would not reset everything and keep settings for the next created world
- Fixed a problem with the bedrock layer generating at 0 under city buildings

1.18-5.0.1:
- Better at preventing cities where there are villages

1.18-5.0.0:
- First port of Lost Cities to 1.18

1.16-4.0.10-beta:
- Fixed the problem where beds would explode right after teleporting to and from the Lost City dimension

1.16-4.0.9-beta:
- Added back the specialBedBlock config (in lostcities-server.toml) so that you can change the diamond block under the bed
- It is now possible to specify blocks using the standard BlockState format in the palette (for example: minecraft:quartz_slab[type=bottom]) giving many more options for custom assets

1.16-4.0.8-beta:
- Fixed a problem with creation of multiple worlds where the settings of the first world would persist for future worlds. This also fixes the saving of the selected profile in serverconfig/lostcities-server.toml

1.16-4.0.7-beta:
- Fixed loot and spawner generation so that it happens more consistently now

1.16-4.0.6-alpha:
- The ILostCities API is back

1.16-4.0.5-alpha:
- The 'assets' configuration works again so you can reconfigure how Lost Cities looks
- All configuration files for Lost Cities are now in 'config/lostcities'. That makes it easier to find
- There is a new examples/conditions.json which you can use as a sample to reconfigure loot and spawners

1.16-4.0.4-alpha:
- Temporary 'fix' to avoid what looks like a bug in Vanilla when clearing out large sections of a chunk. This bug manifests itself when clearing up chunks after being damaged by an explosion
- Better city generation with 'floating' landscape type by improving the way the height of a chunk is detected
- New 'cityAvoidVoid' config option: Only used with floating landscape type: if true an additional detection is done to see if the chunk is void and in that case the city isn't generated there. Otherwise you might get city chunks on the border of islands which sometimes looks weird
- The 'dimensionProfiles' config option has been renamed to 'dimensionsWithProfiles' to force a regen
- The bed with skulls (and diamond blocks) works again and will teleport to the 'lostcities:lostcity' dimension if present
- New 'lostcities:lostcity' dimension in the datapack. You can reconfigure this with a datapack by replacing the lostcity dimension type and/or dimension

1.16-4.0.3-alpha:
- Considerably improved Lost City worldgen on world types that use the standard NoiseChunkGenerator

1.16-4.0.2-alpha:
- Register the configured feature for Lost Cities so that it should improve compatibility with other mods generation

1.16-4.0.1-alpha:
- Some serious optimizations which will improve the speed of worldgen in combination with lost cities

1.16-4.0.0-alpha:
- First port to 1.16.3: alpha!

1.15-3.0.2-alpha:
- Fixed a problem on servers

3.0.1-alpha:
- Avoid generating Lost Cities in biomes that are marked as 'void'
- Avoid a crash with some blocks (beehives) causing out of bounds errors during chunk generation
- mmcgill refined the above fix so the crash testing is actually not really needed

2.0.28-alpha:
- Fixed a crash in Lost Cities loading existing worlds

2.0.27-alpha:
- Added lc_cavern worldtype for cavern style worlds
- The Lost City configuration screen (LC button) will now select 'cavern' as first option if you are using lc_cavern
- New 'Transport' configuration page so that you can configure railways and highways
- The standard profiles as they are saved in the config/lostcity_profiles are now read-only and will be generated again everytime the game starts. You can make a copy of them under a new name and modify it for your own needs
- Nicer Lost City configuration button

2.0.26-alpha:
- Fixed a problem with cities generating under very high biomes. Sometimes pieces of the original landscape were still present
- Potentially fixed an issue correcting block states in a not-fully-generated chunk
- Fixed the check if a biome is an ocean or not
- Fixed the detection of biomes in general
- Lower the stone border a few blocks so it is always covered by terrain (there were sometimes gaps with ocean chunks adjacent to street chunks)
- Clear land above above-ground railway stations

2.0.25-alpha:
- Fixed generation of bridges. They never really appeared
- Slightly changed the offset of lower mesh terrain gen so it always matches (remove configs for this to work)
- Fixed a problem where customizing a profile could cause crashes

2.0.24-alpha:
- Implemented a much better landscape correcting algorithm so that city chunks fit much better with adjacent high mountains or very low ocean chunks
- Vines are now handled in a much more efficient manner. Should avoid the TPS problems people were getting
- Oceans, rivers, and beaches are now recognized in a way that allows modded biomes to work too
- When a highway is generated it will no longer remove leaf blocks and logs above the highway
- When Lost Cities starts for the first time it will generate a config/lostcity_profiles folder containing standard profiles. As long as that folder exists Lost Cities will not do that again. You can alter/copy/remove profiles in that directory and they will be recognized automatically
- New 'saveprofile' command to save the current profile to a file (which you can then copy to config/lostcity_profiles)

2.0.23-alpha:
- Fixed a problem on servers

2.0.22-alpha:
- First port to 1.14.4!

2.0.21:
- Joseph added a more useful error message when invalid parts are configured

2.0.20:
- Fixed water level issue when combining biosphere with drowned cities, thanks to @3TUSK
- New parkChance profile option that allows you to control the chance that a non-building section will be a park section. If you set this to 0 you will only get streets
- wormzjl fixed explosion leaving a crater on water surface in submerged city style
- wormzjl reports: currently when combining sphere with submerged cities, all outside ground appears to be a mixture of grass + sand, creating a lot of block update lag. This temporarily fixes this issue by replacing underwater toppings with gravel

2.0.19:
- The client support (including fog) was accidentally removed

2.0.18:
- Spanish (Argentina) support for the generator names from TBM13
- English (upside-down) support for the generator names from The Fireplace
- Fix a possible crash in case a compact machine is placed in a city sphere (by Thraaawn)
- Force filtered biomes to actually check for allowed biomes (by esotericist)

2.0.17:
- Fixed a rare crash with explosion handling during generation

2.0.16:
- Umbra Gaming fixed a sponge compatibility issue

2.0.15:
- Fixed a problem in the safe driver which caused it to crash

2.0.14:
- New config option 'optimizedChunkgen' that can be used to disable the optimized chunkgen that Lost Cities normally uses and switch to a 'safer' version
- If NEID or JEID is installed this new safer chunkgen is used automatically

2.0.13:
- Joseph added more useful error reporting if a factor or mapping is invalid

2.0.12:
- New profile config option to change the default base liquid to use while generating the world ('liquidBlock')
- New profile config option to change the default base block to use while generating the world ('baseBlock')

2.0.11:
- Log an error if we detect that a block's TileEntity is wrong

2.0.10:
- Removed some spam from the console

2.0.9:
- Fixed a crash bug in combination with the Aroma Mining Dimension

2.0.8:
- Added support for multiple Lost City dimensions through the new ADDITIONAL_DIMENSIONS config. These dimensions are not accessible with the usual method. They are mostly intended for pack devs who need multiple city dimensions with various properties (profiles)
