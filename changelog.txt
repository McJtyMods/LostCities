- The standard worldstyle avoids rivers slightly and oceans a bit more

1.18-5.2.6:
- New system to control city rarity based on perlin maps. If the cityChance setting is -1 then cityPerlinScale and cityPerlinOffset will be used for a more natural city style
- New 'cityStyleThreshold' and 'cityStyleAlternative' that can be used to select another city style for low city thresholds
- New 'largecities' profile using the new setting. It presents very large cities that are relatively rare. It also uses an alternative city style at the borders of the city

- The test if a chunk is an ocean chunk was totally wrong. This caused some generation to be ugly. Cleaned up biome test code
- Small optimizations
- Added a new 'grass' block to the 'parkblocks' in the city style so that you can use the full palette system for grass in parks
- Added a new 'generalblocks' section to city style so you can specify a few more blocks ('ironbars', 'glowstone', ...)

- Added back the specialBedBlock config (in lostcities-server.toml) so that you can change the diamond block under the bed
- It is now possible to specify blocks using the standard BlockState format in the palette (for example: minecraft:quartz_slab[type=bottom]) giving many more options for custom assets

1.16-4.0.8-beta:
- Fixed a problem with creation of multiple worlds where the settings of the first world would persist for future worlds. This also fixes the saving of the selected profile in serverconfig/lostcities-server.toml

- Better city generation with 'floating' landscape type by improving the way the height of a chunk is detected
- New 'cityAvoidVoid' config option: Only used with floating landscape type: if true an additional detection is done to see if the chunk is void and in that case the city isn't generated there. Otherwise you might get city chunks on the border of islands which sometimes looks weird
- The 'dimensionProfiles' config option has been renamed to 'dimensionsWithProfiles' to force a regen
- The bed with skulls (and diamond blocks) works again and will teleport to the 'lostcities:lostcity' dimension if present

- New 'saveprofile' command to save the current profile to a file (which you can then copy to config/lostcity_profiles)

2.0.23-alpha:
- Fixed a problem on servers

2.0.22-alpha:
- First port to 1.14.4!
